<h2>What Percentage of US Households Own a Pet?</h2>
<p>Pet ownership rates fluctuate every few years in the United States, but they’ve generally been on the rise. <a href="https://www.avma.org/blog/pet-ownership-rise" title="Pet Ownership Is On The Rise | AVMA">In 2018</a>, about 57% of US households include at least one pet.</p>
<p>The most recent <a href="https://ebusiness.avma.org/ProductCatalog/Product.aspx?ID=1529" title="Pet Ownership &amp; Demographic 2018 PDF | AVMA">Pet Ownership &amp; Demographic Study (2018) by the AVMA</a> shows that dogs are the most popular pets in the United States, followed closely by cats. This has been true since 1987, and likely since before then, too. </p>
<p>Americans are also fond of fish, horses, and other types of small furry creatures. Some Americans also keep an exotic animal or two at home. But some states don’t allow residents to keep certain exotic animals privately, and most states don’t allow residents to keep wild animals without special permits.</p>

<p>Looking at more recent raw numbers, Spots.com estimates that there has been a slow but steady increase in the number of dog and cat owners over the past several years. According to their <a href="https://spots.com/pet-ownership-statistics/" title="Pet Ownership Statistics | Spots.com">Pet Ownership Statistics study</a>, there are actually <strong>85 million households</strong> in the US keeping pets, which means <strong>67% of American homes</strong> included a pet in 2020:</p>

<p>Most states include plenty of pet parents, but there are some differences in pet ownership depending on where you look. </p>
<p><strong>States with large rural areas tend to have the highest rates of pet ownership.</strong> You’re also likely to find more dog owners in warm, rural states like Texas and more cats in colder states like Maine and Washington, according to <a href="https://www.zippia.com/advice/states-with-the-most-dogs-cats/" title="DOG STATES VS CAT STATES: STATES WITH THE MOST DOGS | Zippia">Zippia</a>.</p>

<h2>Interesting Pet Ownership Data</h2>
<p>There are also differences in pet ownership based on age group, income, and other factors. </p>
<p><strong>Millennials</strong>—who have reached ages between 25 and 39 years old in the last decade—have received special attention because of their high rate of pet ownership. But they only constitute <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/baby-boomers-and-millennials-are-redefining-modern-pet-ownership-trends-reports-packaged-facts-300963558.html" title="Baby Boomers and Millennials are Redefining Modern Pet Ownership Trends, reports Packaged Facts | PR Newswire">27% of all pet owners</a> according to Packaged Facts.</p>
<p>But <strong>Baby Boomers</strong> have an even higher rate of pet ownership. Individuals in the 55 to 74-year-old age group increased their rate of pet ownership from 50% to 54% according to the same study. They also make up about 47% of aggregate expenditures on pets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rate of pet ownership among 40 to 54-year-olds has stayed at about 64%.</p>
<p>According to studies conducted by the Urban Institute, pet ownership is also <a href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/housing-survey-reveals-five-trends-about-american-pet-owners" title="A housing survey reveals five trends about American pet owners | Urban Institute">more nuanced than you might imagine</a>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Most people are <strong>more likely to have a pet in their home than a child</strong>, except for people in their 40s. </li>
<li>Homeowners and married couples are more likely to own pets than others, but there are far more households with pets than there are with children under 18.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s even a <strong>correlation between your income and what types of pets you like</strong>. Ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) individuals tend to like horses and dogs more than cats, fish, and birds, according to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/09/the-worlds-wealthiest-tend-to-be-dog-people-not-cat-people.html" title="The world’s wealthiest tend to be dog people, not cat people | CNBC">research firm Wealth-X</a>:</p>

<p>This data shouldn’t be that surprising. </p>
<p>Animal care is expensive, and horses are more expensive than other types of animals to keep and care for. Dogs are also more expensive to own and care for than cats, so it makes sense that a household with a bigger pet budget would be more willing to own a dog.</p>
<p>Pawlicy Advisor, a national pet insurance marketplace, surveyed over 20,000 pet owners recently and found that <a href="https://www.pawlicy.com/blog/pet-insurance-statistics-2019-2020" title="Fascinating Pet Insurance Statistics from 2019-2020: Breeds, Pre-Existing Conditions, Pet Names and More | Pawlicy Advisor">only 1 out of 5</a> could afford to pay a common $5,000 vet bill without insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <a href="https://www.bettercitiesforpets.com/resource/dog-owners-vs-cat-owners/" title="Cat An Dog Owners: The Purrplexing Differences | Better Cities For Pets">a study by Mars Pet Care</a> found that there are clear differences between dog and cat owners.
<span id="3"> </span></p>
<h3>Differences Between Dog and Cat Owners</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dog owners</strong> are twice as likely to work in the financial field than cat owners.</li>
<li>A <strong>cat owner</strong> is four times as likely to work in creative fields than a dog owner.</li>
<li><strong>Dog owners</strong> are more likely to enjoy hobbies like sports, dancing, and travel.</li>
<li><strong>Cat owners</strong> are more likely to enjoy hobbies like reading, writing, and gardening.</li>
<li>70% of <strong>cat owners</strong> credit their pets with stress reduction, compared to 66% of dog owners.</li>
<li>45% of <strong>dog owners</strong> say their dogs improve their lives through exercise, compared to just 8% of cat owners.</li>
<li><strong>Dog owners</strong> are twice as likely to celebrate their pet’s birthday with a party than cat owners.</li>
</ul>
<p>A another study from <a href="https://www.dvm360.com/view/comparison-cat-owners-vs-dog-owners" title="A comparison of cat owners vs. dog owners | dvm360">a veterinary digest</a> found that cat ownership is more common among women and older Americans: About 58% of cat owners are women, and the average age of cat owners is 55 to 64 years old.
